# Image Segmentation using OpenCV

#### Objective:
This project aims to implement a segmentation algorithm to identify individual grains within images stored in a specified folder and extract their average color. 

#### Algorithm Implementation:
The algorithm involves preprocessing images, applying segmentation to each image, and saving the data in a dataframe.

#### Dependencies:
- OpenCV: For image analysis.
- Numpy: For numerical data handling.
- Pandas: For data storage.

#### Usage:
Run the `run.py` script with the path to the image folder as an argument. For example:
```
python run.py Images
```

#### Potential Applications:
This algorithm can be useful in material science, agriculture, and image analysis, automating tasks like grain size measurement and color analysis.

#### Future Improvements:
Future work may focus on optimizing the algorithm, integrating machine learning techniques, and improving user interface.
