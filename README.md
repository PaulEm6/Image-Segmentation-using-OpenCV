# Image Segmentation using OpenCV

#### Objective:
The objective of this project is to implement a segmentation algorithm to identify individual grains within an image and extract the average color of each grain. The approach involves preprocessing the image, applying a segmentation algorithm to the image, and then saving the average color of each identified segment in a dataframe.

#### Algorithm Implementation:
The algorithm consists of three main steps:
1. Preprocessing the image.
2. Applying a segmentation algorithm to the image.
3. Saving the average color of each identified segment in a dataframe.

#### Usage:
To utilize the algorithm, follow these steps:
1. Preprocess the image.
2. Apply the segmentation algorithm.
3. Save the average color of each identified segment in a dataframe.

#### Example:
```
